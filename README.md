# 1v1.YEET-v1
A Cheat Engine hack for the game 1v1.lol 

### Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10 but may work on Mac as well. This has also only been tested on Firefox. 

## INSTRUCTIONS: 

1.) Download Cheat Engine from https://cheatengine.org/ 

*Cheat Engine tends to bundle useless bundleware, so make sure you read the installation window and make sure you are installing only Cheat Engine and not anything else if you don't want bundleware.*

2.) Download Firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ 

3.) Download "1v1.YEET.CETRAINER" 

4.) Open a SINGLE tab to [1v1.lol](https://1v1.lol) in Firefox. Make sure it is the only tab running. 

5.) Go to Task Manager and press the "details" tab.

6.) Scroll down to the firefox processes and look at the process with the most RAM being used.

9.) Press "attach process." The program may freeze for a while, but it shouldn't take long. 

**To make sure you are attached to the right process, enter a number in the "speed" box. If everything becomes faster, that means you are attached to the right process. Since speed will always work, this is also a good method to test if the hack is patched. If speed doesn't work, then you are attached to the wrong process. Try again.**

10.) Enable the features and destroy your friends at the game! 

### IMPORTANT: Please don't use this in competitive/ranked matches(the ones where you can gain/lose trophies) unless you are playing against your friends.
